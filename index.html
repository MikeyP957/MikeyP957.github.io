                <h5>What I have learned as an educator</h5>
                <p>
                    In my early years of teaching I thought that student understanding came from how well the teacher explained the material. While this idea is partially true, I was missing many opportunities to understand what my students were  actually learning, not just hearing. I remember one day, a student telling me that I was doing too much work and that I needed to make the students work harder. In hindsight this feedback was paramount to my future successes as an educator.

                <p class="asAnEdu2" style="display: none;">
                    I started to learn how to establish collaborative learning in my classroom, where students shared ideas, worked as a group and allowed me to get a glimps of how they understood the content I was presenting. The steps I took were to first build relationships between me and my learners help them build relationships with each other. This relationship building allowed for a safe place where learners could ask questions, take risks and really explore their own understanding and the understanding of others. I learned the importance of creating clear and consistent expectations, routines and protocols so our learning environment was predictable allowing students to focus their brain power on the learning and instead of prodcedures. And lastly I learned the importance of positive recognition so that students were able to identify their strengths and start building stronger understanding.

                <p class="asAnEdu" style="display: none;">
                    While working on different committees in my building I have found that these practices are not exclusive to student learning but can be applied anywhere people are working together in creating innovative solutions to complex problems.

                <h5>What I like about coding</h5>
                <p>
                    The first time I became engaged in a coding problem was while I was teaching high school mathematics and I facilitated the "Hour of Code" in my classroom. I did not know much about coding at the time but thought it would be an enriching activity for my students. As I helped students answer various questions I started to appreciate some of the basic concepts such as loops, conditionals and linear thinking. These concepts reminded me of some of my favorite subjects in my undergradate degree, like number theory, geometric proofs, and infinate series. These subjects taught me how to break down problems into smaller steps, how to explain my own thinking and how to create clear and concise solutions.

                <p>
                Whether I am out at at the crag or climbing in the gym I seem to meet coders again and again. This could be coincidental, however, I have found that climbing and coding share some common prinicples such as problem solving, collaboration and paying attention to detail. As I progress in my climbing I find new ways to approach routes as I learn new moves, get in different positions and encounter new holds.

                    They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Don’t ever play yourself. I’m up to something. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Special cloth alert. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.
