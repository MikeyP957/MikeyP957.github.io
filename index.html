                    They never said winning was easy. Some people can’t handle success, I can. Don’t ever play yourself. I’m up to something. Find peace, life is like a water fall, you’ve gotta flow. In life there will be road blocks but we will over come it. They key is to have every key, the key to open every door. Learning is cool, but knowing is better, and I know the key to success. Special cloth alert. Major key, don’t fall for the trap, stay focused. It’s the ones closest to you that want to see you fail.
