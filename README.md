# MikeyP957.github.io

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to provide evidence of my proficiency and growth as a coder. Proficiency of my code will be found on the "portfolio" page and growth will be shown through my GitHub repository through commits and refractors. How I see myself as a coder and a professional can be seen on my personal about me page. 

## Languages and technologies
This project shows my ability to utilize Bootstrap in HTML to build a structure for the content of my pages. 

## Launch
As of 01/06/2021 this project is currently a work in process. As I continue to learn, practice and work on different languages and technologies my portfolio will change accordingly.
